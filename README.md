# STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF SERVICES VALUE ADDED (CURRENT LCU) & GDP PER CAPITA (CONSTANT LCU)

## Abstract of the Analysis
This analysis aims to examine the relationship between Services, value added (current LCU) and GDP per capita (constant LCU) using statistical analysis. The analysis extracted data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. The Indian economy has been growing rapidly in recent years, driven in part by the expansion of the services sector. This paper analyzes the contribution of the services sector to value added and GDP per capita in India, using current LCU (local currency unit) data.
The analysis finds that the services sector has been a major contributor to economic growth in India. Between 2000 and 2019, the share of services in GDP increased from 42% to 55%. This growth was driven by a number of factors, including the expansion of the IT and outsourcing sectors, as well as the growth of the retail and tourism sectors.
The growth of the services sector has had a number of positive benefits for the Indian economy. It has created jobs, boosted exports, and helped to reduce poverty. However, it has also led to some challenges, such as rising inequality and environmental degradation.
The paper concludes by discussing the challenges and opportunities facing the Indian services sector in the future.
Here are some of the key findings of the analysis:
1.	The services sector has been a major contributor to economic growth in India.
2.	The growth of the services sector has been driven by a number of factors, including the expansion of the IT and outsourcing sectors, as well as the growth of the retail and tourism sectors.
3.	The growth of the services sector has had a number of positive benefits for the Indian economy, including job creation, export growth, and poverty reduction.
4.	However, the growth of the services sector has also led to some challenges, such as rising inequality and environmental degradation.
5.	The Indian government is taking a number of steps to address these challenges, including investing in education and healthcare, promoting rural development, and improving environmental regulations.
The analysis of Indian services, value added (current LCU) and Indian GDP per capita (constant LCU) provides valuable insights into the Indian economy. The findings of the analysis can be used by policymakers to develop policies that will support continued economic growth and development in India.


## INTRODUCTION

### Definition

Indian services are the economic activities that do not produce goods. They include things like healthcare, education, transportation, and tourism. The services sector is the largest contributor to India's GDP, accounting for over 50% of the total value added in 2019.
Value added is the difference between the value of the outputs of a sector and the value of the inputs used to produce those outputs. In other words, it is the amount of value that is created by the sector. Value added is a measure of economic productivity and is often used to compare the performance of different sectors or countries.
GDP per capita (constant LCU) is the gross domestic product (GDP) divided by the population. It is a measure of the average income of a country's citizens. GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year. LCU is a unit of account that is used to measure economic activity in different countries. It is calculated by converting the value of economic activity in a country's currency into a common currency, such as the US dollar.

Here are some examples of Indian services:
	Healthcare: Hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities
	Education: Schools, colleges, and universities
	Transportation: Airlines, railways, buses, and taxis
	Tourism: Hotels, resorts, and other tourist attractions

The services sector in India is growing rapidly, and it is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including:
1.	The rise of the middle class in India
2.	The increasing demand for services from businesses and consumers
3.	The growth of the IT and outsourcing sectors
4.	The government's focus on developing the services sector
   
The growth of the services sector is having a positive impact on the Indian economy. It is creating jobs, boosting exports, and helping to reduce poverty. However, it is also leading to some challenges, such as rising inequality and environmental degradation.

The Indian government is taking a number of steps to address these challenges, including:
1.	Investing in education and healthcare
2.	Promoting rural development
3.	Improving environmental regulations
   
The growth of the services sector is a key driver of economic growth in India. The government's policies are helping to ensure that this growth is inclusive and sustainable.


### STATISTICAL CONCEPT AND METHEDOLOGY

The statistical concepts and methodologies used in the analysis of Indian services, value added (current LCU) and Indian GDP per capita (constant LCU) are as follows:
•	Descriptive statistics are used to summarize the data and describe its main features. This includes measures of central tendency, such as the mean, median, and mode, as well as measures of dispersion, such as the range, interquartile range, and standard deviation.
•	Inferential statistics are used to make inferences about the population based on a sample. This includes hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
•	Time series analysis is used to study the changes in a variable over time. This includes trend analysis, seasonal analysis, and cyclical analysis.
•	Econometrics is the use of statistical methods to study economic data. This includes regression analysis, time series analysis, and panel data analysis.
The statistical concepts and methodologies used in the analysis of Indian services, value added (current LCU) and Indian GDP per capita (constant LCU) are important for understanding the Indian economy and its performance. They can be used to identify trends, track progress, and make informed decisions about economic policy.
Here are some examples of how these statistical concepts and methodologies can be used:
•	Descriptive statistics can be used to describe the size and composition of the Indian services sector. For example, they can be used to show how the sector has grown over time, what are the major subsectors, and what are the employment trends.
•	Inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses about the Indian services sector. For example, they can be used to test whether the sector is growing faster than the overall economy, whether it is creating more jobs, and whether it is contributing to economic growth.
•	Time series analysis can be used to study the changes in the Indian services sector over time. For example, it can be used to identify trends in the sector's growth, employment, and productivity.
•	Econometrics can be used to study the relationship between the Indian services sector and other economic variables. For example, it can be used to test whether the sector's growth is correlated with the growth of the overall economy, the level of investment, or the education level of the workforce.
The statistical concepts and methodologies used in the analysis of Indian services, value added (current LCU) and Indian GDP per capita (constant LCU) are a powerful tool for understanding the Indian economy and its performance. They can be used to identify trends, track progress, and make informed decisions about economic policy.


### CALCULATION

The calculations used in the analysis of Indian services, value added (current LCU) and Indian GDP per capita (constant LCU) are as follows:
•	Value added is calculated as the difference between the value of the outputs of a sector and the value of the inputs used to produce those outputs. In other words, it is the amount of value that is created by the sector.
•	GDP per capita is calculated as the gross domestic product (GDP) divided by the population. It is a measure of the average income of a country's citizens. GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year.

The calculations for value added and GDP per capita are as follows:
Value added:
Value added = Output – Input

GDP per capita:
GDP per capita = GDP / Population

The data for value added and GDP per capita is collected by the government and published in statistical yearbooks. The data is collected from a variety of sources, including businesses, government agencies, and households.

The calculations for value added and GDP per capita are used to track the performance of the Indian economy and to make informed decisions about economic policy. The calculations can be used to identify trends, track progress, and make comparisons between different countries.

For example, the calculations can be used to show how the Indian services sector has grown over time, how it compares to other sectors of the economy, and how it compares to other countries. The calculations can also be used to identify trends in the Indian economy, such as the growth of the services sector, the decline of the manufacturing sector, and the rise of inequality.

The calculations for value added and GDP per capita are a powerful tool for understanding the Indian economy and its performance. They can be used to identify trends, track progress, and make informed decisions about economic policy.
